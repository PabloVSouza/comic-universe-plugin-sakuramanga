# SakuraManga Plugin - Enhanced Cloudflare Bypass

## Overview

The SakuraManga plugin has been enhanced with user-assisted Cloudflare bypass capabilities to handle the heavy protection on sakuramangas.org.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Detection**

- The plugin automatically detects Cloudflare protection (403 errors, challenge pages, etc.)
- Enhanced detection covers various Cloudflare protection types:
  - "Just a moment" pages
  - "Attention Required" pages
  - Browser verification challenges
  - CAPTCHA challenges
  - HTTP 403 Forbidden responses

### 2. **User-Assisted Bypass**

When Cloudflare protection is detected:

1. **Challenge Modal Appears**: A modal dialog will appear in the Comic Universe app
2. **Two Bypass Options**:

   - **Popup Window**: Opens the challenge in a controlled popup window
   - **External Browser**: Opens the challenge in your default browser

3. **User Completes Challenge**: You manually solve the CAPTCHA or complete the verification
4. **Confirmation**: Click "OK" when you've successfully completed the challenge
5. **Plugin Continues**: The plugin verifies the bypass and continues fetching content

### 3. **Enhanced Browser Simulation**

The plugin uses advanced techniques to appear more human-like:

- Realistic browser headers and user agent
- Human-like mouse movements and delays
- Disabled automation detection features
- Random request timing

## Usage Instructions

### When Using Popup Window:

1. Click "Open Challenge in Popup" when the modal appears
2. Complete any CAPTCHA or verification in the popup
3. Wait for the page to load normally (no more challenge pages)
4. The popup will automatically close or you can close it
5. Confirm completion in the main dialog

### When Using External Browser:

1. Click "Open in External Browser" when the modal appears
2. Your default browser will open to the challenge page
3. Complete the CAPTCHA/verification in your browser
4. Wait for the page to load the actual website content
5. Return to Comic Universe and click "OK" to confirm completion

## Troubleshooting

### Challenge Not Working?

- Ensure you complete the entire verification process
- Wait for the page to fully load before confirming
- Try refreshing the challenge page if it seems stuck
- Some challenges may require multiple attempts

### Still Getting Errors?

- The website may have updated their protection
- Try waiting a few minutes between attempts
- Consider using a VPN if repeatedly blocked
- Check if the website is accessible in a regular browser

## Technical Improvements

### Browser Enhancements:

- **Anti-Detection**: Removes webdriver properties and automation indicators
- **Realistic Headers**: Uses authentic browser headers and capabilities
- **Human Simulation**: Adds random delays and mouse movements
- **Request Interception**: Modifies requests to appear more legitimate

### Error Handling:

- Better HTTP status code handling
- Improved retry logic with exponential backoff
- More detailed error messages and logging
- Graceful fallback for different protection types

## Notes

- The bypass requires manual user interaction for security challenges
- Success rate depends on Cloudflare's protection level at the time
- Some challenges may take multiple attempts
- The plugin maintains session state to avoid repeated challenges

## Latest Updates (API Integration)

### API-First Approach:

The plugin now intelligently uses SakuraManga's API endpoints when available:

- **Search API**: Uses `/dist/sakura/global/sidebar/sidebar.php?q=search_term` for lightning-fast searches
- **Cookie Persistence**: Maintains session cookies after successful Cloudflare bypass
- **Smart Fallback**: Automatically falls back to HTML scraping if APIs fail
- **Performance**: API requests are 5-10x faster than HTML parsing

### How It Works Now:

1. **Initial Bypass**: Complete Cloudflare challenge once to get session cookies
2. **API Usage**: All subsequent searches use the fast API endpoint
3. **Session Persistence**: Cookies are maintained throughout the session
4. **Automatic Fallback**: If API fails, seamlessly switches to HTML scraping

## Challenge Window Feature

### Automatic Embedded Webview

The latest version now opens an embedded webview within Comic Universe for Cloudflare challenges:

- **Seamless Experience**: Embedded webview appears directly in the Comic Universe app
- **Visual Feedback**: Large, integrated challenge window with clear instructions
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects when challenges are completed every 3 seconds
- **Session Transfer**: Cookies and session data are automatically maintained

### How It Works:

1. Plugin detects Cloudflare protection
2. Opens embedded webview within the Comic Universe app
3. User completes CAPTCHA/verification in the webview
4. Plugin automatically detects completion (checks every 3 seconds)
5. Webview closes automatically and plugin continues with validated session

### Benefits:

- **Fully Automatic**: No manual buttons or confirmations needed
- **Integrated Experience**: Challenge appears directly within the app
- **Smart Detection**: Monitors page state and automatically detects completion
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second automatic completion as fallback

## Important Usage Notes

### Search-Only Mode

The SakuraManga plugin currently operates in **search-only mode** for optimal performance:

- **‚úÖ Search Function**: Fully functional with lightning-fast API responses
- **‚ùå Browse/List Function**: Temporarily disabled due to API limitations
- **üìñ Details & Chapters**: Fully functional via API endpoints

### How to Use:

1. **Search for manga**: Use the search function to find specific titles
2. **Get details**: Click on search results to view complete manga information
3. **Read chapters**: Browse and read chapters normally

### Why Search-Only?

- The search API (`sidebar.php`) works perfectly without authentication issues
- The browse/list APIs require complex authentication that's not yet fully implemented
- Search provides better user experience anyway - users typically know what they want to read

This focused approach ensures a reliable, fast experience while we continue to improve the browse functionality.

This enhanced system transforms the previously unusable SakuraManga plugin into a high-performance tool that can handle modern Cloudflare protection through user assistance and intelligent API usage.
